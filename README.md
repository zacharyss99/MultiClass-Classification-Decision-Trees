In this problem, I constructed and evaluated classification models to predict student outcomes (“Dropout,” “Enrolled,” or “Graduate”) using demographic, socio-economic, and academic data available at the point of enrollment. 

The aim was to identify students at risk and understand the factors contributing to their academic outcomes.

Included dataset from paper "Early Prediction of Student’s Performance in Higher Education: A Case Study" by Martins et al

0. EDA and General Preprocessing (Class Imbalance)
1. OvR Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Developed Custom Random Forest Model For Kaggle Competition. 
4. Compared all three models based on F1 score, accuracy, and interpretability
